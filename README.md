# choose-your-own-adventure

This is a vacation project and as such mostly made for me to learn and left in a reasonable state with lots more that could be done. 

I wanted to try out using a graph visualization and write some javascript (I seem to always end up in Python on my vaction projects). 

I had recently played a text based 'choose your own adventure" game and figured it'd be neat to have an editor for such games that would make it easy and fast to prototype out the story.
